        It's been a while since we had a meetup, so we're going to have a super-giant-big-fun afternoon get-together to make up for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        There'll be four talks, and a bunch of
        other things.
      </p>

      <h3>The Plan</h3>

      <p>This is exactly kind of pretty much probably the way the afternoon is maybe going to pan out:</p>

      <h4 class="👏 🗣">First talk <span class="🤷‍♀️">(tbc)</span></h4>
      <h4 class="👏">Show &amp; Ask</h4>
      <h4 class="👏 🗣">Second talk <span class="🤷‍♀️">(tbc)</span></h4>
      <h4 class="👏">Show &amp; Tell</h4>
      <h4 class="👏 🗣">Third talk <span class="🤷‍♀️">(tbc)</span></h4>
      <h4 class="👏">A game of some kind</h4>
      <h4 class="👏 🗣">Fourth talk <span class="🤷‍♀️">(tbc)</span></h4>

      <p>We're still on the look out for speakers at the moment, do get in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben">Ben</a> if you'd like to give a talk.</p>
